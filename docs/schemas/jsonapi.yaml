    An include file to define the [{json:api} 1.0 specification](http://jsonapi.org/format).


    This file also provides a limited demonstration of jsonapi with path items for collections, items
    and their methods. You should be able to open in a modern version of
    [swagger-editor](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor) or
    [swagger-ui-watcher](https://github.com/moon0326/swagger-ui-watcher).


    This file was created by downloading the [schema definition](http://jsonapi.org/schema)
    and then editing as needed to make it useful with the Open API Specification. It is subject
    to the `CC0 1.0 Universal` license as it is derived from the {json:api} specification.


    Several changes had to be made to that schema since it is non-normative and primarily only documented
    the results of GET operations. See especially definitions of `post_datum`, `post_resource`, `datum`,
    and `metaonly` that were added.


    **USAGE**


    You can reference definitions in this schema with `$ref` as defined in the OAS specification, but
    be aware that the
    "[[Reference Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#reference-object)]
    cannot be extended with additional properties and any properties added SHALL be ignored." So $refs are pretty
    useless if you are trying to keep things DRY.

    Specifically, you'll need to copy and the path items into your own schema doc and "extend" them by adding
    what you need (e.g. security, additional parameters, referneces to your app's request/response schemas, etc.).
    For example:

    ```

    paths:
      /courses/:
        get:
          description: Returns a collection of courses
          operationId: find courses
          security:
            - basicAuth: []
            - oauth: [auth-columbia, read]
          parameters:
            # I wish I could pull all these in at once...
            - $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/parameters/include'
            - $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/parameters/sort'
            - $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/parameters/pageSize'
            - $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/parameters/pageNumber'
            - name: 'filter[id]'
              in: query
              description: exact id
              required: false
              style: form
              schema:
                $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/schemas/id'
          responses:
            '200':
              description: course response
              content:
                application/vnd.api+json:
                  schema:
                    $ref: '#/components/schemas/CourseCollection'
            '401':
              description: not authorized
              content:
                application/vnd.api+json:
                  schema:
                    $ref: './jsonapi.yaml#/components/schemas/error'

    ```

    You can locate this file on a web server or in a local directory and `$ref` it appropriately; `swagger-ui-watcher`
    will follow the `$ref`s and can be used to "bundle" your schema into a single JSON document as follows:

    ```

    swagger-ui-watcher -b myapp.json --path myapp.yaml

    ```
